MyDaemonV0 installation instructions
Updated 26th April 2020

1) Cloudspeech credentials
The MyDaemon spoken user interface uses Google CloudSpeech for both speech to text (STT) and text to speech (TTS). There are two implementations, one for a PC and one for a Raspberry PI. Both require credentials from Google in the form of a JSON though they need to be put in different places for the PI and PC version. 

For the PC version, go to the Google Cloud Console https://console.cloud.google.com/. You need to set up a project and activate the cloudspeech (STT and TTS) apis. CLick top left, go to APS and services, enable APIS and services, and enable:
Cloud Speech-to-Text API
Cloud Text-to-Speech API

Next, go to credentials and create a service account. Look up online how to do this. You have to then click on the service and create a key that will be downloaded as a JSON file.

Copy the JSON file into the MD_SPOKEN_UI directory.

Update the hardcoded path in md_stt_pc.py and md_tts_pc.py with the name of the JSON.
