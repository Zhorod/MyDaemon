1) Cloudspeech credentials
The MyDaemon spoken user interface uses Google CloudSPeech for both speech to text (STT) and text to speech (TTS). There are two implementations, one for a PC and one for a Raspberry PI. Both require credentials from Google in the form of a JSON though they need to be put in different places for the PI and PC version. 

For the PC version, go to the Google Cloud Console https://console.cloud.google.com/. You need to set up a project and activate the cloudspeech (STT and TTS) apis. CLick top left, go to APS and services, enable APIS and services, and enable:
Cloud Speech-to-Text API
Cloud Text-to-Speech API

Next, go to credentials and create a service account. Look up online how to do this. You have to then click on the service and create a key that will be downloaded as a JSON file.

Copy the JSON file into the MD_SPOKEN_UI directory.

Update the hardcoded path in md_stt_pc.py and md_tts_pc.py with the name of the JSON.
